Issue: 2
https://github.com/JimmyLambert/RaiderBreaker/issues/2
Branch name: AddStudentMajor
To resolve this issue, I looked for the model, viewer and controller that would need to be modified to add a student’s major field to the account creation menu. The Person.java model needed to be modified to include a major variable of type Textfield. AccountController.java was analyzed and modified to include methods to handle the student major, and CreateAccount.fxml was modified to include the textfield in the GUI. I created a branch, AddStudentMajor.

    Add Textbox for student's Major to viewer file, CreateAccount.fxml

Commit Discussion: These were the first commits I made, so I took a gingerly approach to the volume of modified code. I made a commit after modifying each of the targeted files, and detailed the modifications in the commit message. My testing shows that users can now enter their student major during the account creation process, but I did not test any backend database use of this new field. I would also make some changes to the viewer so that the textbox is more flush with the GUI layout.
