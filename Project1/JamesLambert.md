I managed the github repo
There were a total of 6 pull requests

I merged all six of these. 
the pull request index html I reviewed it and it had
general improvments to the web page
the pull request Salutation error added the feature that the user could choose to cancel the action, and also added a null check.
the pull request remove task type warning adds a pop up that confirms if
the removal has gone through.
the pull request Add textfield major and validateMajor() to AccountController.java, upâ€¦ added a method that checks to see if the major the user adds is a valid one.
the pull request Fix Branching Error was my own pull request that was simply to fix a brancing error.
the pull request Add student major field and getters/setters added getters and setters to the student major field.

For all of these pull requests, I used a local clone, merged the branches manually, and then after solving all merge conflicts (if any) pushed the changes back to github.
